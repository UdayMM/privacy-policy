## Account Deletion

### How to Delete Your Account

Patients can delete their accounts at any time through the app:

1. Login to your account
2. Tap the profile icon (👤) in the top-right corner
3. Tap "Delete Account" in the Danger Zone
4. Confirm deletion

### What Gets Deleted Immediately

When you delete your account, we permanently delete:

- Your patient profile (name, age, address)
- Mobile number and authentication credentials
- Notification tokens and preferences
- App preferences and saved filters
- Your ability to login to the app

### What We Retain for Legal & Healthcare Compliance

**Medical Appointment Records:**

Under healthcare regulations (Medical Council of India guidelines and hospital record-keeping laws), we are **legally required** to retain:

- Your appointment history with doctors
- Your name and basic information in booking records
- Visit dates and doctor consultation details
- Payment records for appointments

**Why We Retain This Data:**

1. **Legal Requirement:** Healthcare providers must maintain patient visit records for 7-10 years per medical regulations
2. **Doctor Compliance:** Doctors need historical records of patient visits for medical-legal purposes
3. **Hospital Compliance:** Hospitals must maintain appointment logs for regulatory audits

**Your Privacy is Protected:**

- You **cannot be contacted** through our app after account deletion
- Your **profile is deleted** - you won't appear in searches
- Booking records are **accessible only to doctors/hospitals** who treated you
- Records **cannot be linked back** to your deleted account for marketing or other purposes
- We **do not use** this data for any purpose except legal compliance

### Data Retention Timeline

### Re-creating Your Account

If you sign up again with the same mobile number:

- A **fresh account** is created

### Legal Basis for Data Retention

We retain appointment records under:

- **Medical Council of India (MCI) Regulations**
